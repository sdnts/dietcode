# Demystifying CORS

I've been making chages to [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)'s CORS implementation
this week, and now I think I know more about CORS than anyone really needs to know,
especially how S3 implements it ðŸ¤®. It gets a bad rep. At its core, it is a remarkably
simple, and dare I say elegant system -- it's the edge cases that do it in. [CITATION
NEEDED]

Before we even begin, _the_ most important thing to realize is that CORS is orchestrated
entirely by the client, which in most cases is a web browser (or things emulating
web browsers). You can bypass CORS entirely by just using `curl` to make your HTTP
request. But we'll see later why this isn't as big a deal as it sounds. In the rest
of this post, I'll assume we're in a web browser.

**The core idea is that a server should be able to control who can interact with it.**
This can be useful for security, privacy, or to prevent abuse -- all with the caveat
that it can be bypassed easily, but I won't keep mentioning it. CORS is also no
substitute for proper authorization, again, because it can be easily bypassed.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing by the way. `example.com` and `localhost:3000`
are examples of "origins".

### How does it work?

The best way to learn how CORS policies work is to build them yourself, so we'll
do that. If you're in a hurry, skip to the [TL;DR](#tldr).

So say you've got a server up on `userstore.com` that exposes three endpoints:

1. `HEAD /users` returns the number of users registered on your service
2. `GET /users` lists all usernames
3. `PUT /users` creates a new user

You're talking to it from `localhost:3000`. You write some JavaScript to send it a
HEAD request to get the number of users:

```typescript
const count = fetch("http://userstore.com/users", {
  method: "HEAD",
});
console.log(`We have ${count} users`);
```

Run this, and you get hit with the classic

![CORS error](/p/cors/cors-error.png)

> ```
> Access to fetch at 'http://userstore.com/users' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
> ```

So many new terms!
`userstore.com` and `localhost:3000` are different origins, and as such the browser
is preventing `localhost:3000` from accessing resources (in this case, the `/users`
endpoint) from `userstore.com`. The browser is preventing sharing resources across
origins. The browser is preventing Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. You see where that
acronym comes from?

By default, browsers assume that JavaScript on `localhost:3000` has no reason to
make requests to `userstore.com`, because they're different websites. This is an
important security measure to ensure that there's more standing between your pizzeria
and your bank account than a measly `fetch` request.

But if you control both domains and actually _do_ want them to be able to share resources,
you can set up a CORS policy on your server, which is fancy-talk for defining what
kind of clients are allowed to talk to your server, and what kinds of actions they
can perform. We'll do this as we go along. If you're in a hurry, skip to the [TL;DR](#tldr).

### Getting HEAD requests to work

To really understand what's happening, our `fetch` call isn't going to help us much,
so let's look at the raw HTTP request that went out:

```http
HEAD /users HTTP/1.1
Host: userstore.com
Origin: http://localhost:3000
```

(In HTTP, the `Host` header tells you where the request is headed, and the `Origin`
header tells you where it is coming from. Your `fetch` call sets the `Host` depending
on your `url` parameter, and your browser sets the `Origin` header. JavaScript
cannot control the `Origin` header, so it is always accurate)

And here's the response that came back:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

10
```

Huh, looks like the server responded with a `200` _and_ the number of users, and
yet our JavaScript didn't get this response.

What's happening here is that the browser is intervening. It looks at the response,
sees that there is no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, and thinks the server
does not want the current origin to be able to read this response. This is exactly
what the error also says, if you read it again:

> ```
> Access to fetch at 'http://userstore.com/users' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
> ```

So let's help the browser out, let's go to our server (`userstore.com`), and set
the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the [format it needs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin):

![Screenshot of the server's code showing that we're now setting the additional Access-Control-Allow-Origin header](/p/cors/head-with-cors-header.png)

Our request/response pair now looks like this:

```http
HEAD /users HTTP/1.1
Host: userstore.com
Origin: http://localhost:3000


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json

10
```

That was it! We no longer see a CORS error in our browser, and we're able to read
the response of our `HEAD` request in JavaScript.

Our server told the browser that it was okay to let `localhost:3000` access the
resource in question (in this case, the `/users` endpoint), and the browser acknowledged,
letting our JS access the response's body. **We've just set up a CORS policy**. The cool part about this is
that the browser didn't have to make a separate request to ask the the host (`userstore.com`)
which origins are allowed to talk to it, it just piggybacked off the actual `HEAD`
request. Just to be crystal clear, our JavaScript hasn't changed:

```typescript
const count = fetch("http://userstore.com/users", {
  method: "HEAD",
});
console.log(`We have ${count} users`);
```

Super important to realize: CORS policies are set on the server! There's nothing
a client can do if it is seeing CORS errors, and this is by design.

Sick, so this was simple, all we had to do was set a single header in the server's
response. Let's try to get our `PUT` / `GET` requests working next.

### CORS Preflights

Let's wade into the (apparently) more confusing parts of CORS. We want to now try
and get our `PUT` request to work, so we modify our `fetch` call:

```typescript
const count = fetch("http://userstore.com/users", {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
    "User-Id": "11" // This header is added for demonstration only, it'll become clear why in a bit
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "user10" }),
});
console.log("Created user with id 11");
```

![A screenshot of the browser's DevTools, showing that two requests went out when we called fetch just once](/p/cors/preflight.png)

Er, what? It looks like our one `fetch` call actually
ends up creating two network requests. If we investigate, one of them has a `Type`
of `preflight`, and the other one is a `fetch`. The `preflight` request has the
HTTP method `OPTIONS`. This is, of course, expected behaviour.

When it comes to CORS, all `fetch` requests are classified into two categories:
"simple" and "preflighted". The browser decides which category your request belongs
to, but in general, requests that **might** cause server-side mutations are preflighted,
and others are considered "simple". In our case, the browser decided that the `HEAD /users`
request was "simple", but the `PUT /users` request isn't. How the browser makes
this decision is covered later.

Think about this: The whole idea behind CORS is that a host server (`userstore.com`) defines the origins (`localhost:3000`)
that are allowed to access it. **Because CORS is orchestrated entirely
by the client, what actually happens is that the request that your browser sends
is processed by the server, but the response to that request may not be made available
to the JS that requested it**. So sure, for a `HEAD /users` request, the server returns
the number of users, but your JS may not be allowed to read the response that contains
it, depending on the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, like we saw in the
previous section. But this becomes problematic when your `fetch` asks the server
to do mutations, like deleting an existing user. The browser cannot just send a `DELETE /users`
request and deny the response to JS, because the JS succeded in doing what it wanted,
it deleted a row from the server's database. The fact that the browser denies reading
the response to the JS doesn't matter, the damage is already done. In these cases,
the browser must explicitly ask the server if the request it intends to send is allowed.
It does this using a preflight request. **If a preflight request fails (returns
anything other than a 2xx status code), the actual request is not sent at all**.

So let's look at this preflight request. This is what it looks like:

```http
OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1
Host: http://userstore.com
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: User-Id
```

So if the idea behind this preflight request is to explicitly ask the host (`userstore.com`)
if a request is allowed, this `OPTIONS` request describes the request that it is
about to send:

- The `Origin` header of this `OPTIONS` request says that the the origin `locahost:3000` is trying to make this request
- The path says that the origin would like to send a request to `/users`
- The `Access-Control-Request-Method` says that the origin would like to send a `PUT` request
- The `Access-Control-Request-Headers` says that the origin would like to send a `User-Id` header (this is a comma-separated list if there are multiple headers in the intended request). Note that the actual value of the header isn't sent, just the name.

The server gets these things, decides if the origin is allowed to perform the action
it wants, and then returns a `2xx` response status to give your browser the go-ahead.
The browser then sends the actual `PUT /users` request, with the headers and everything.
Any other status code is considered a rejection, and the `PUT /users` request doesn't
go out at all.

So in our case, our server doesn't even know how to handle `OPTIONS` request, so
it returns a `400`, and so we see a CORS error. Let's fix that real quick. This is
what we want the request / response pair to look like:

```http
OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1
Host: http://userstore.com
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: User-Id


HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: User-Id
```

The server is explicitly saying that on the `/users` path,

- The origin `http://localhost:3000` is allowed, via the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. Note that this is the same header that is used in "simple" requests as well. Also note that the port is part of the address. This becomes important during development!
- The method `PUT` is allowed, via the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods` header (this is a comma-separated list if multiple methods are allowed on this path)
- The header `User-Id` is allowed, via the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header

Once the browser gets this confirmation (AKA the status code is `2xx` and the `Access-Control-*`
headers are kosher), the `PUT /users` request goes out and we do not see a CORS error!

![Successful CORS preflight and request](/p/cors/successful-preflight.png)

One weird quirk here is that the `PUT` request's response must also contain the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
header, even though the browser did get explicit permission from the host server during the preflight.
To be honest, this seems unnecessary, but this is one of the ugly bits of CORS. If
you're setting CORS up, remember this!

Again, our `fetch` request is still the same. This is worth repeating: CORS policies
are only set on the server!

Alright now that you know this, **please stop setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
to `*`! You're unnecessarily allowing all kinds of actors on to your server!**

### The ugly bits

So far, things have been kinda elegant, right? The browser tries to minimize the
number of requests it sends to your server. If it thinks the request cannot really
do any damage ("simple" requests), it piggybacks off the actual request to figure
out if the JS that initiated the request is allowed to do it. But if the request
seems dodgy, it'll send a "preflight" request to make sure your server approves
the request before making it.

(Of course there's a huge caveat here that your server is actually following REST
verb principles: only reads in `GET` requests, create-or-replace for `PUT`s etc.
This is one reason why these conventions exist. _cough_ GraphQL _cough_)

The thing that does CORS in (understandability-wise) is that the decision to send
preflights isn't as straight-forward as checking the request's verb (`GET` / `PUT`
etc.). There are cases when even a `GET` request can trigger a preflight, for example
if it tries to send a custom header (anything that isn't `Content-Type` with some
allowed values). This is because functionality of these custom headers isn't part
of any conventions, so it is hard to figure out what the server will do with it.
To err on the side of caution, the browser will preflight such requests. [MDN's CORS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
is a surprisingly good read to understand how browsers decide which requests to preflight.
Hopefully that page will feel a lot less dense now that you've read this post.

### How does CORS actually help with security?

If it hasn't been obvious so far, CORS only protects you if your client is willing
to respect the `Access-Control-*` headers. Web browsers are very strict about this,
but you can bypass CORS checks using `curl`. This isn't a problem though. CORS isn't
an end-all solution because it doesn't have to be. If the primary goal here
is to stop `dominos.com` from sending a mutating request to `yourbank.com`, then
that has been accomplished. JS cannot bypass CORS in any way. It also cannot break
out of the browser's shell. `curl` isn't an attack vector because that indicates
that the attacker has physical access to your computer, which is very much not what
CORS is supposed to protect against.

### <AnchoredHeading id="tldr">TL;DR</AnchoredHeading>

Say you have a server on `userstore.com`. Authentication is irrelevant, but you do
not want just about anyone to be able to send you requests, or embed your content.
CORS exists to make this possible.

There are two kinds of requests an origin can make: simple ones that only read data
out of your server, and others that **might** mutate data (such as incrementing a
visitor counter). The browser looks at the request you're trying to send, and makes
a decision about what kind of request it might be. It does so by inspecting the request
method, body and headers. For simple requests (that's what they're literally called),
it will send the request out to the host server, but it will check to see if the
server's response has a header called `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` whose value
matches the origin the request was made from. If it does, then all's well, the response
body is supplied to the JavaScript that initiated the request. If it doesn't, the
JavaScript doesn't get to read the response, and you see a CORS error that reads:

> ```
> Access to fetch at 'http://userstore.com/users' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
> ```

The important thing to realize is that the simple request did actually go out to
your server, which responded. Since authorization isn't a consideration, this is
not harmful because it was just a read, after all. This is what the HTTP conversation
might look like:

```http
HEAD /users HTTP/1.1
Host: userstore.com
Origin: http://localhost:3000


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json

<Response-Body>
```

However, if the browser thinks that the intended request **might** mutate state on
the host server, it actually sends out two requests, the first is called a preflight
request that is basically a description of the actual request. Your server is expected
to read this description and respond with a `2xx` status code to allow the request,
or anything else to reject it. This preflight request uses the `OPTIONS` verb, and
this is what the request / response pair might look like:

```http
OPTIONS /users HTTP/1.1
Host: http://userstore.com
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
Access-Control-Request-Headers: User-Id


HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: User-Id
```

The browser asks the server if a `PUT` verb (indicated by the `Access-Control-Request-Method` header)
on `/users` (indicated by the pathname of the `OPTIONS` request) is allowed from
the origin `http://localhost:3000` (indicated by the `Origin` header) with the additional
header `User-Id` (indicated by the `Access-Control-Request-Headers` header).

If all these params are acceptable, the server responds, saying that the origin `http://localhost:3000`
(indicated by the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header) is allowed to send a `PUT` verb
(indicated by the `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`) on the requested path (`/users` in this case),
along with the additional headers `User-Id` (indicated by the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
header). The browser will then verify this response, and send out the actual `PUT` request
if all's good. **The `PUT` isn't sent out at all if the server does not allow it!**

How the browser decides if a request needs a preflight has a few edge cases -- it
is not as straight-forward as checking the request's verb. These are documented pretty
well in [MDN's CORS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS),
which is a great read regardless.

### Conclusion

Hopefully this has demystified CORS for people reading! Most full-stack developers
think CORS is an untameable beast, but I think that mostly comes from a place of ignorance. I
was firmly in that camp too a couple of weeks ago. It really isn't that bad.
